                    <p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. 
                        Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the <strong>first</strong> commercial spacecraft in <strong>history</strong> 
                        to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments. 
                        It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. 
                        Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. 
                        Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable Dragon to fly crew. 
                        Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.</p>

                                <li> DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES - Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and currently the only cargo spacecraft flying capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Dragon accommodates pressurized cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.</li>
                                <li> VERSATILE CARGO RACKS - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment. They accommodate a variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological samples.</li>
