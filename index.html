                    <h2 class="section-title">What is Progressive Enhancement?</h2>
                <p>Progressive enhancement is a website development strategy that prioritizes loading essential content and functionality of websites while reserving unnecessary content to devices and browsers that can handle it.</p><br/>
                <p>This strategy aligns with how we've learned the material this semester. We began by learning the fundamentals of HTML, including structure, tags, and elements (the core functionality). As we progressed through the semester, we learned how to style our webpages with CSS and incorporated bits of front-end Javascript to make our website look good (the unnecessary content).</p>
                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>By prioritizing the essential content, we make the website accessible to anyone, regardless of the user’s device or web browser. This maximizes the user experience, which is one of the most important goals in web development.</p>

                    <p>This class was awesome, and the knowledge I gained from it was immense. I recollect my early days of web development when I used w3school’s compiler and transitioned into Neocities for more serious projects (these projects were minuscule compared to even the prototype assignment). Seeing my skills develop in such a quick time was amazing, and Professor Thomas played a major role. His lectures were easy to understand, was more than willing to help anyone experiencing issues, and had us code with him to help us engrain the material, showing how much he cares for the success of his students. Because the lectures were easy to understand, it was much easier to learn the material. It was not hard for me to remember the numerous tags and elements used in HTML, as well as CSS syntax. However, I could have managed my time much better. It has been a constant battle with me getting burned out quickly, so crunching assignments was not uncommon. This is something I’m going to have to manage in order to make it into the CS field as time management skills are essential.</p>
                    <p>This project was difficult. I’m not very creative when it comes to aesthetics, so brainstorming ideas on how to lay out my webpage was the most challenging aspect of this assignment. This was especially evident in my first draft, showing clear signs of lackadaisical effort. While there are still areas that could be improved, I believe that my revised final is miles better than my draft. I implemented various technical and creative skills I learned while revamping my homepage into my final assignment, and I believe it paid off. I incorporated animations and stylized the website somewhat similarly to how SpaceX would under the recommendations from friends. While it was one of the more challenging assignments out of all my classes this semester, it was the most fun.</p>
